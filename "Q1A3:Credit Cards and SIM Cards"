Credit Cards and SIM Cards

When dealing with numbers like credit card numbers and student numbers, it’s useful to have a quick way to detect data entry errors. A common solution is the Luhn Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm ) where the digits of a number are added together. If the sum is divisible by 10, the number is considered to be valid, otherwise it is not.

This is commonly done by taking an existing number (e.g. a bank account number) and adding an additional digit, called a "check digit", so that it will pass Luhn’s Algorithm.

Write the Python function

add_check(n)
that consumes a 4 digit natural number n, and adds a check digit (to the right, i.e. the "ones" column).

Note: You are not required to check whether or not the number is valid, only to add a check digit to n to make it valid

Example:

add_check(8675) => 86754
Explanation: Notice that 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 26 This is 4 away from 30, so the check digit must be 4.

Code:
def add_check(n):
